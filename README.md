# LLM-Project
This repository documents my step-by-step approach toward building an open-source large language model (LLM). The project is organized into chapters, with each chapter represented by a Jupyter Notebook that covers a specific component of the LLM pipeline.

*This project follows instructions from the book [Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)](https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch) by Sebastian Raschka.* <a href="#cite">(i)</a>

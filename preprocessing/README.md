# Chapter 2: Working with Text Data

### Main Chapter Code

- [ch02notebook.ipynb](ch02notebook.ipynb) contains all my code, along with line-by-line explanations as directed in this chapter.
- [the-verdict.txt](the-verdict.txt) is the raw data set used for tokenization in this chapter.

In this chapter, the focus is on preparing the textual data necessary for building a large language model. The notebook demonstrates
**how to tokenize raw text, convert tokens into numerical IDs, and generate the continuous vector representations through token and positional embeddings.** This foundational work is essential for structuring and pre-processing the input data, which will later feed into more advanced stages of model architecture and training in subsequent chapters of the project.
